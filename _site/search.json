    "text": "L’analyse de la pauvreté par l’imagerie satellitaire repose sur l’extraction de caractéristiques spatiales et environnementales à partir de données optiques (Sentinel-2) et nocturnes (VIIRS). Grâce aux techniques d’apprentissage profond, notamment les réseaux de neurones convolutifs (CNN), il est possible d’associer l’apparence visuelle d’une zone à des indicateurs socioéconomiques observés au niveau des ménages.\nNotre approche intègre :\nLa collecte d’images géoréférencées autour de points GPS issus d’enquêtes de terrain (comme l’EHCVM),\nL’extraction de caractéristiques visuelles par transfert d’apprentissage (modèles VGG préentraînés),\nLa régression ou classification de la pauvreté à partir de ces caractéristiques,\nEt l’estimation de taux de pauvreté ou de dépenses de consommation à haute résolution spatiale.\nCette méthodologie ouvre de nouvelles perspectives pour la production de statistiques à faible coût, continues dans l’espace, et actualisables plus fréquemment que les enquêtes traditionnelles. Elle soutient les politiques publiques, le suivi des ODD, et les stratégies de ciblage social."

Cette démarche vise à produire des indicateurs fiables, dynamiques et granulaires sur le marché du travail en Côte d’Ivoire : secteurs porteurs, profils les plus demandés, géographie de l’emploi, évolution des types de contrats, etc.\nLes données collectées permettent :\nD’identifier les tendances sectorielles et géographiques de la demande d’emploi ;\nDe construire des profils types par catégorie de poste, niveau d’études ou d’expérience ;\nD’alimenter des tableaux de bord dynamiques pour appuyer la prise de décision publique et la veille économique."

    "text": "En exploitant les données librement accessibles sur le web, notre travail se concentre sur deux axes complémentaires :\nLa collecte automatisée des prix à la consommation à partir des plateformes de commerce en ligne, en vue de la production de l’indice des prix à la consommation (IPC), permettant un suivi de l’inflation plus rapide, détaillé et à grande échelle.\nL’analyse des offres d’emploi recueillies quotidiennement via le web scraping, afin de produire des indicateurs dynamiques du marché du travail — tels que les compétences les plus recherchées, la répartition géographique des postes, les dynamiques sectorielles et les types de contrats proposés.\nCette double approche renforce l’efficacité de la production statistique nationale, en offrant des alternatives innovantes et peu coûteuses aux méthodes traditionnelles de collecte de données. Les tableaux de bord et indicateurs qui en résultent appuient la conception des politiques publiques, le diagnostic du marché de l’emploi et le suivi macroéconomique."

Touching a hot pan’s lid provides a simple and all too familiar example of such thermal conduction. As a material’s size is reduced to 10-100s of nanometers, or about 1,000 times smaller than a human hair, depositing and maintaining thermal energy within a small region of space becomes even more challenging. Yet the ability to control heat flow and thus temperature at nanoscopic dimensions has important implications for applications ranging from data storage and local chemical reaction control to photothermal therapies for disease treatment and pain management through ion channel stimulation.\nWith support from the National Science Foundation Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) Program, Professor David J. Masiello from the University of Washington, Professor Katherine A. Willets from Temple University, and Professor Stephan Link from Rice University are developing methods to theoretically design and experimentally realize a new class of materials capable of controllably directing temperature increases to nanoscale regions of space using light. Beyond impacting a wide variety of applications, the project is also facilitating the interdisciplinary training of students and postdoctoral researchers through student exchange between the three research groups.",
